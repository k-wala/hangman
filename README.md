# Hangman

## Description

The classic game - guess letters one at a time to reveal the secret word with only 5 lives. 

By calling the play_game() function, users are asked to enter a letter one at a time. If guessed correctly, the progress of the guessed letters within the hidden word will be shown. 
If guessed incorrectly, the number of lives will reduce until all 5 have been used up. 

This project served as a refresher for some basic Python such as loops, if/else statements and functions, but also enabled me to bring all the aspects together using classes and git. 

## Installation

    from milestone_4 import play_game

    play_game(word_list)
